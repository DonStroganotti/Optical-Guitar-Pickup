# Optical-Guitar-Pickup

This project came to be because I was feeling frustrated by how much noise a normal magentic guitar pickup, picks up from surrounding electronics. 

First prototyped on a breadboard and mounted in a 3D printed chassi.

When the prototype was confirmed to work I began designing a PCB to make it easier to fit everything in the small footprint.
